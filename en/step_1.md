## What you will make
Get started with the Raspberry Pi Camera Module, using Python and picamera. You'll take still pictures, record video, and apply image effects.

## What you will learn
By following the 'Getting started with picamera' resource, you will learn:

- How to connect the Camera Module to the Raspberry Pi
- How to use Python to control the Camera Module
- How to use `start_preview()` and `stop_preview()` to control the camera preview
- How to take still pictures with `capture()`
- How to record video with `start_recording()` and `stop_recording()`
- How to play back video with `omxplayer`
- How to alter the brightness and contrast
- How to apply image effects and exposure modes

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):
